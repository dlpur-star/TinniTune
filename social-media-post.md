**Title**: I built TinniTune - a free, open-source tinnitus therapy app with 85% clinical alignment

**Body**:

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a project I've been working on: **TinniTune** - a web-based tinnitus therapy application that implements evidence-based treatment protocols.

**Key Features:**

1. **Notched Sound Therapy** - Uses the clinically-validated 1.0 octave notch protocol (Okamoto et al., 2010) with proper Q-factor calculations

2. **Binaural Beats** - Multiple modes tested in clinical trials:
   - 10 Hz (Alpha) for daytime focus
   - 6 Hz (Theta) for evening calm
   - 2 Hz (Delta) for deep sleep

3. **Cardiac Coherence Breathing** - Visual breathing guide synchronized with optimal resonance frequency (0.1 Hz)

4. **Advanced Calibration** - Multi-stage frequency matching with octave verification to prevent common calibration errors

5. **Session Tracking** - Monitor your progress with before/after ratings and compliance metrics

**Technical Details:**
- Built with React and Tone.js
- Progressive Web App (works offline, installable)
- All data stored locally (privacy-first)
- No backend, no tracking, completely free

**Clinical Alignment:**
I've documented the research basis for every feature. The app currently achieves 85/100 alignment with latest audiology research (see CLINICAL_ROADMAP.md for details).

**Try it:**
- Demo: https://dlpur-star.github.io/TinniTune/
- Source: https://github.com/dlpur-star/TinniTune

I'm looking for feedback from the community, especially from audiologists or anyone with tinnitus who's tried various therapies. What works? What doesn't? What features would be most helpful?

This is completely open-source and free. My goal is to make evidence-based tinnitus therapy accessible to everyone.
